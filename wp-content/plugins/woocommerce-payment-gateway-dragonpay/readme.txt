== Description ==

Dragonpay is an online payment platform that allows consumers to buy online from e-commerce merchants without traditional forms of payments like credit card and Paypal. Instead the buyer uses his online banking facility or pay cash over-the-counter at physical retail channels. Dragonpay provides alternative online payment solutions to businesses of all sizes. Customers can purchase goods or services online and pay for it using cash or check at physical, brick-and-mortar payment counters, ATM's, mobile wallets or through online bank debit. 

This WooCommerce plugin allows to integrate Dragonpay API to your woocommerce websites and accept online payment using the dragonpay payment solutions.
